ITERATION 3 - PRIORITY: FIXING WEBHOOK RECEPTION IN NODE.JS
===============================================================

ISSUE STATUS:
PHP logs show webhook forwarded successfully, but Node.js NOT receiving it.

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED IN ITERATION 2:
✗ webhook.js was using webhookService as a require() - WRONG
✓ FIXED: Changed to instantiate WebhookService class with db and redis

CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:
Changed from:
  const webhookService = require('../services/webhook-service');
To:
  const WebhookService = require('../services/webhook-service');
  const webhookService = new WebhookService(db, redis);

This was causing webhook.processWebhook() to fail silently!

OTHER FIXES IN THIS ITERATION:
✓ Fixed webhook route to properly instantiate WebhookService
✓ Added db and redis imports to webhook route
✓ Added module load logging
✓ Verified campaign route already correct

ALL FIXES SUMMARY (Iterations 1-3):
✓ localhost → 127.0.0.1 (everywhere)
✓ Port 3000 → 3006 (everywhere)
✓ Node.js binds to 127.0.0.1 explicitly
✓ PHP config defaults fixed
✓ PHP POST payload fixed (getContent() instead of all())
✓ WebhookService instantiation fixed with db/redis
✓ Comprehensive logging added everywhere
✓ Added NODEJS env vars to Source/.env

TESTING REQUIRED:
1. User must restart Node.js: pm2 restart whatsjet-nodejs
2. User must clear PHP cache: php artisan config:clear
3. Send test WhatsApp message
4. Check pm2 logs whatsjet-nodejs for [WEBHOOK POST] logs
5. Report results
